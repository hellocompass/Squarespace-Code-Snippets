# Resize Header on Scroll
![Resize Header on Scroll](ResizeHeaderOnScroll2016.gif?raw=true)

If you are customizing a Squarespace site that does not have the option to shrink the header/logo/nav items on scroll, here is the code to let you add that functionality. I made this for the Bedford theme. Other themes may use different class names and IDs. 

## Installation
1. Copy everything in [src/code_injection.html](src/code_injection.html) into the [Code Injection section](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/205815908-Using-Code-Injection)
of you Squarespace site.
2. Copy everything in [src/custom_css.css](src/custom_css.css) into the
[Custom CSS section](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/206545567)
of your Squarespace site.

That's it!

## Customization
To customize how much the header, logo and nav items shrink, or to change opacity, give a box shadow, modify the CSS in
[src/custom_css.css](src/custom_css.css). I have included inline comments indicating where to make these changes.
